# I don't think we need to have this done rn, as long as our
# crawler is actually running by deployment date

# as far as this goes I thought It'd be easier to just createa a function
# that prints out everything we need

#1. Unique pages - we just have to create a list of unique urls
# and loop through the lines in analytics_data and skip empty/duplicate
# urls

#2. Loop and Compare word count of current URL to a 'longest' variable
# and if its > then just update it to the new longest one

#3. I think common words is pretty easy, we already did something similar
# in assignment 1. 

#4. Gotta do some parsing here I assume, lowkey I gotta go to work tonight
# so I'm going to leave this for later unless you want to try it rn
